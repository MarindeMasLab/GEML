# Integrating Machine Learning with Genome-Scale Metabolic Models for Precision Trauma Care

Overview

This repository contains the code used in the article "Integrating Machine Learning with Genome-Scale Metabolic Models for Precision Trauma Care: Personalized ENDOTYPE Stratification and Metabolic Target Identification."

The project integrates machine learning (ML) with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to advance precision trauma care. By leveraging computational models, it enables personalized ENDOTYPE stratification and helps identify metabolic targets tailored to individual patient profiles.

## Key Features

**Machine Learning for Patient Stratification**: ML algorithms classify patients into metabolic ENDOTYPES based on clinical and metabolic data.

**Genome-Scale Metabolic Model Integration**: GEMs are used to analyze metabolic pathways and identify patient-specific differences.

**Metabolic Target Identification**: Potential therapeutic targets are identified by linking ML predictions with metabolic model outputs.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes scripts for:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing clinical and metabolic data.

- **Model Training**: Implementing ML algorithms for patient classification.

- **Metabolic Analysis**: Integrating GEMs to identify metabolic targets.
