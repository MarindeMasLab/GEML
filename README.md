# Mechanistic Machine Learning Uncovers Metabolic Switch Reactions Underlying Trauma Endotypes

Overview

This repository contains the code used in the article "Mechanistic Machine Learning Uncovers Metabolic Switch Reactions Underlying Trauma Endotypes".

The project integrates machine learning (ML) with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to advance precision trauma care. By leveraging computational models, it enables personalized ENDOTYPE stratification and helps identify metabolic targets tailored to individual patient profiles.

## Key Features

**Machine Learning for Patient Stratification**: ML algorithms classify patients into metabolic ENDOTYPES based on clinical and metabolic data.

**Genome-Scale Metabolic Model Integration**: GEMs are used to analyze metabolic pathways and identify patient-specific differences.

**Metabolic Target Identification**: Potential therapeutic targets are identified by linking ML predictions with metabolic model outputs.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes scripts for:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing clinical and metabolic data.

- **Model Training**: Implementing ML algorithms for patient classification.

- **Metabolic Analysis**: Integrating GEMs to identify metabolic targets.
