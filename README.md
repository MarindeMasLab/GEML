# Integrating-Machine-Learning-with-Genome-Scale-Metabolic-Models-for-Precision-Trauma-Care
This repository contains the code used in the article "Integrating Machine Learning with Genome-Scale Metabolic Models for Precision Trauma Care: Personalized ENDOTYPE Stratification and Metabolic Target Identification."

The project integrates machine learning (ML) with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to advance precision trauma care. By leveraging computational models, it enables personalized ENDOTYPE stratification and helps identify metabolic targets tailored to individual patient profiles.

## Key Features
Machine Learning for Patient Stratification: ML algorithms classify patients into metabolic ENDOTYPES based on clinical and metabolic data.
Genome-Scale Metabolic Model Integration: GEMs are used to analyze metabolic pathways and identify patient-specific differences.
Metabolic Target Identification: Potential therapeutic targets are identified by linking ML predictions with metabolic model outputs.
This repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and metabolic analysis. Contributions and discussions are welcome! ðŸš€
